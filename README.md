This is the classic Minesweeper game, designed to resemble the Google version. The game is built using vanilla **JavaScript**, **HTML5**, and **CSS3** without the use of external libraries or frameworks.

I practiced programming with stuff like **OOP**, **dynamic programming**, **matrix**, **queue**, **events**, **localStorage**, advance CSS like **flex**, **grid**, **variables** and **animations**, **modules** ES6, **design patterns**, **responsive** design, **flood fill** and so on.
